            <H3>CERAMIC-COATING</H3>
            <P>Advanced coatings derived with nano-technology that help prevent environmental damages on your car’s precious paint. These coatings form a 9H or 10H hard crystallised layer on top of your vehicle’s clear coat and provide resistance against light scratches, chemical / acids and also protects the paint against harmful UV rays. You will also experience hydrophobic properties with the application of these coatings, which would avoid water markings to a great extent. These coatings are available with 3, 5 and 7 year application warranty plans.
